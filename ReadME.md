## üß© Introduction
**Problems-svc** is a scalable backend microservice built to manage a comprehensive set of coding problems. These problems span traditional Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) challenges and real-world API simulation exercises. The service serves as the backbone of a broader platform aimed at assessing and improving users' programming skills through structured exercises.

This microservice provides RESTful APIs that allow platform administrators and editors to create, organize, and curate problems. Each problem can include metadata like time/memory constraints, version history, difficulty level, topic tags, and supported languages. Problems are grouped into sheets (like playlists), and can be served dynamically to users in practice modules or assessments.

Whether it's a binary search challenge or building a REST API for a bookstore, **Problems-svc** enables consistent problem definition and retrieval, acting as a single source of truth for the problem-solving engine of the platform.

## üìå Project Status

> **üöß Development Status: Complete**
The Problems-svc is feature-complete and actively maintained. It's now integrated into the broader ecosystem of services that deliver practice environments and problem-solving challenges. Future updates may include:
- Enhanced analytics and problem usage tracking.
- Multi-language translation support for problem statements.
### ‚úÖ Completed Milestones
- Core API design and implementation.
- Full CRUD support for problem sheets, types, languages, and playlists.
- Judge0 integration for language execution.
- Role-based access controls and token validation.
- Deployment-ready configuration for production environments.

## üöÄ Features
### üîç Problem Authoring and Management

- **DSA Problem Definitions**  
  Support for typical algorithm problems (e.g., sorting, graph traversal) with input/output examples, constraints, and test cases.

- **API-based Problem Authoring**  
  Define REST API challenges, including request/response contracts and validation logic. Perfect for simulating real-world backend tasks.

- **Flexible Metadata Support**  
  Attach metadata such as:
  - Time limits
  - Memory usage
  - Visibility flags (public, private, draft)

### üóÇÔ∏è Organization & Discovery

- **Sheet Type System**  
  Organize problems into logical groups such as ‚ÄúBeginner DSA,‚Äù ‚ÄúSystem Design APIs,‚Äù or ‚ÄúSQL Challenges.‚Äù

- **Tagging and Categorization**  
  Use tags to denote topics (e.g., "binary tree", "authentication"), difficulty (easy, medium, hard) and company (amazon, google, meta). Tags enhance filtering and discovery on the platform.

- **Language Compatibility Mapping**  
  Specify which languages (e.g., Python, Java, JavaScript) a problem supports. Essential for test case validation and code execution.

- **Playlists (Collections)**  
  Curate problems into thematic collections or learning tracks. A single problem can belong to multiple playlists.

### üîê Secure API

- **Token-Based Auth (JWT)**  
  Every endpoint is protected via bearer tokens. Access scopes can be restricted based on user roles (admin, editor, reader).

- **Input Validation via OpenAPI**  
  OpenAPI specs are used to validate request data, ensuring strict schema compliance and minimizing the risk of malformed or malicious inputs.

### üîÑ Integration with Execution Engine

- **Judge0 Integration**  
  Problems-svc integrates seamlessly with the Judge0 execution engine to compile and run submitted code, supporting multiple programming languages via Dockerized runners.

- **Code Snippets and Solutions**  
  Retrieve pre-filled code templates or reference solutions specific to a problem and language.

## Usage
This service acts as a backend repository of problems, feeding the UI and execution engines with structured problem data. Users interact with it indirectly while solving challenges through the platform.

## üîê Security
- All APIs are secured with Bearer Tokens using JWT-based Auth.
- Role-based access control enforces permissions.
- OpenAPI specs are used for input validation to ensure request safety and data integrity.
